description: Read-only readiness census for evidence-gated skills in the current repository — distinguishes targets ready for Skill Evolution, queued pre-close evidence that remains deferred, evidence a review could not decide and retired as untestable, eligible targets that remain blocked, and stores whose eligibility cannot be determined.

# Skill Evolution Status

Run one read-only readiness census across `reports/skill-evidence/` in the current repository. This skill is a reporter, not an authorizer: the destination session's fresh Skill Evolution preflight remains final.

Arguments: none.

## Hard boundaries

- Read-only repository state: never write `events.jsonl` or `gate-status.json`, run a preflight or derive command that refreshes projections, claim a review, or modify a target. Cargo may write only its ordinary build and cache artifacts while starting the compiled reporter; if the host cannot provide a writable build cache, report that the reporter did not run.
- Census only: never diagnose incidents, inspect target prose semantically, propose repairs, invoke Skill Evolution, or record evidence.
- Current repository only: never search sibling repositories or a global evidence directory.
- Canonical mechanics only: use the compiled command's shared Rust event validation, target hashing, and in-memory gate derivation; never duplicate eligibility thresholds or trust a stored projection as current.
- Safe uncertainty: never print an evolution command for queued pre-close evidence, evidence retired as untestable, self-targeting, an active timer, an owned review, an unreadable stream, or a missing target.

## Workflow

### 1. Run the census

From the repository root, run exactly:

```bash
cargo run --locked --quiet -p skill-evidence -- skills evolution-status \
  --root . --now-epoch-milliseconds "<clock-ms>"
```

The authoritative census payload is the compiled reporter's stdout, beginning
with `# Skill Evolution Status`. Cargo diagnostics on stderr are not part of
the census. On a safe failure, the compiled command's lifecycle diagnostic on
stderr is the authoritative failure; a Cargo failure before the reporter
starts is an execution failure, not a census result.

Capture one exact census clock in epoch milliseconds and pass it as
`<clock-ms>`; replay with the same value. The compiled command scans every
evidence store, validates `events.jsonl`, hashes each live target, and derives
current gate state without persisting it. It distinguishes the two freshness
proofs explicitly:

- a captured threshold session ID is ready only in another session that exposes a different ID; a no-ID destination remains blocked and waiting does not help;
- a missing threshold session ID uses the 12-hour clock, which another session cannot bypass.

It also relays the canonical post-review provenance derived by Skill Evidence Capture. Evidence that could only have fired before a completed same-hash review is reported as deferred and receives no command; a genuinely new post-review incident can reopen the gate, with the bounded trigger cluster and provenance shown on the actionable entry.

Portability contract: run the repository's compiled `skill-evidence` command in a
checkout containing the sibling Skill Evolution skill at its standard
`.claude/skills/` path and the standard `reports/skill-evidence/` store. The
command fails safely when that contract is absent or incompatible.

_Done when the compiled command prints one reconciled census or a safe failure stating that nothing changed._

### 2. Relay the result and stop

Relay the authoritative payload intact. Preserve every reporter line and every emitted command without omission, duplication, reordering, or paraphrase. Host-required framing around that intact payload and normalization of its terminal newline are permitted; they are presentation, not census content. Add no substantive commentary of your own. Commands appear only under `Ready to evolve` and are already shaped for copy-paste into another top-level session. `Deferred after review` identifies the canonical queued subset of collecting stores and explicitly supplies no command, distinguishing evidence queued behind an instrument-limited close that reached no conclusion and could test nothing from evidence behind a concluded close where no threshold-supporting incident was recorded afterward; neither basis claims that the close covered the deferred evidence. `Retired as untestable` names stores whose open incidents left the gate because a review could not decide them, whether by an instrument-limited close or by an adjudicating close naming coverage it could not decide: real evidence that no longer drives eligibility and never will, listed separately so it is not read as an absence of evidence. `Eligible but blocked` gives the active blocker and all available timing, ownership, quarantine, or routing detail. `Could not determine` names stores that might conceal eligibility but cannot be trusted. Other closed, collecting, and current-hash-reset stores appear only in the omitted count.

Two kinds of close contribute to the standing retired set, at different scopes. Each instrument-limited close contributes only the open incidents its recorded authorization reason named at the close: `friction_recurrence` contributes its whole symptom cluster; `material_recurrence` leaves friction siblings outside the retired set; `ten_use_unresolved` excludes retrospective incidents from its anchor cluster; and `severe` contributes no retired incidents. An adjudicating close contributes the coverage it named as untestable, by name and never wider, less anything that still drives the gate on its own — a review that examined its coverage mechanism by mechanism has already said which it could not decide, and a contemporaneous severe incident it named stays in the gate regardless. For historical streams, a missing or unrecognized authorizing rule uses the prior symptom-wide reach. Report the compiled result as written; this explanation changes neither its identities nor readiness.

Do not reinterpret readiness, add commands to blocked entries, suggest early review, or continue into evolution in this session.

_Done when the complete, unchanged census payload or authoritative safe failure has been delivered and no further action was taken._
